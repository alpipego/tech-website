# Contribute

We encourage everyone to take an active part in the organization of this meetup. Among others these are:

## Meeting Minutes 
We aim to have extensive and up-to-date meeting minutes of every meetup we hold. This task should not only sit with speakers and organizers, but we want everyone to add their notes, links, further-reading to our [Meeting Minutes](/meeting-minutes).

Fork the repository @ https://github.com/wp-berlin/tech-meeting-minutes and create a pull request to get involved.

## Website Development 
We have developed a custom WordPress based website for this meetup. Making use of the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and the [Meetup API](https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api) to get the content into this website. 

Start by forking https://github.com/wp-berlin/tech-website. Check out the [Readme](https://github.com/wp-berlin/tech-website/blob/master/README.md) for a start. 

You can also contribute to the development of the [GitHub Markdown to Custom Post Plugin](https://github.com/alpipego/ghcp).
